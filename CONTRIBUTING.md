## CONTRIBUTING ##

I love pull requests!  Please be sure to follow the general coding standards and principles you see in the code.  If you have done a good job with documentation: comments in code, clear and meaningful commit messages, updating any relevant documentation, there is a very good change your code will be merged. 

You can also submit a bug or feature through GitHub's "Issues" feature.  All constructive feedback is welcome.

I will response to correspondence within 2-3 business days.  In general, I try to respond as soon as I see the notification.  In rare cases it may take longer.


## ORIGIN ##

My name is Christopher J. Hanson.  I am the author and maintainer of this library.  Special thank you to [Doug Swisher](/dswisher) for writing the Examples.Web project and being brave enough to consume my code before it was tested.
