## Bigtable.NET Native Library ##

This library contains files generated from a script which uses the protobuf compiler and the grpc plugin.

## Usage ##

To use this library directly, you must handle the eccentricities of the Bigtable API directly, as well as provide authentication.  You may optionally use the [BigtableNET.Common](../Common) library to handle these concerns.
